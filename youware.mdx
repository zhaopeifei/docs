- **Backend:** Node.js / Express / Nest.js or Serverless functions
- **Database / Storage:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB or a cloud DB service
- **AI / Inference:** Integrations with OpenAI APIs or self-hosted inference endpoints
- **File / Code Hosting:** Git / GitHub integration for project sync
- **Deployment / CDN:** Static + API hybrid deployment with global CDN caching
- **Search / Recommendation:** Vector search, full-text index, category-based recommendations
- **Security / Access:** Auth layers, sandboxing, copyright & abuse prevention

> 💡 Tip: This MDX file can be your “Introduction / Overview” page for YouWare Docs.\
> You can then add more pages (e.g., `getting-started.mdx`, `architecture.mdx`, `api-reference.mdx`) and build a complete documentation tree.

Would you like me to generate the **full documentation structure (sidebar.yml + MDX page hierarchy)** for YouWare next? It would look like a ready-to-import Mintlify or Next.js Docs site.
